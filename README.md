**Getting Started**

# After downloading the project, go into your project's home directory and type `. /_env.sh`. This will execute a script that will install all the necessary pods to get you up and running.

----

Be sure to check out a new branch that details what you're working on.
- The naming convention will be `yourFirstName/branchType/branchName`
- Be sure to use lower camel casing. The branch types will either be `bug`, `feature`, or `research`.
- Also ensure your branch names are descriptive of the task, e.g. `nic/bug/loaderViewLag` or `nic/feature/uploadToGoogleDrive`
